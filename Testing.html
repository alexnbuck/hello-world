                                <p>Hello world!<br><br> My name is Alex Buck, I am a rising junior at Tulane University studying
                                Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Management. Before I came to Tulane, I grew up
                                on the coast of Massachusetts, splashed around for about 18 years and found my way down to 
                                New Orleans, the place I now consider my home. I grew up in a very hectic household, with a twin 
                                sister, two stepsisters, a stepbrother, a mother and stepfather and a variety of pets that came 
                                and went as the years passed. However, as time went my siblings all went there separate ways, leaving 
                                at home just me, my mother, and my twin sister.</p>
                                <p>My first experience with programming was in my Junior year of high school when I decided to 
                                take AP Computer Science. In this class, we learned the fundamentals of programming through Java 
                                (which in my opinion was a very hard language to start out on, but in the end it gave me a great 
                                head start to my programming career). When I learned about the coordinate major at Tulane, I 
                                decided I would give it a shot. After two semesters and four classes, it's become clear that 
                                computer science is a serious passion for me and I am incredibly excited to continue my education.</p>
